				<p>My name is Aaron Holmes Hale.I grew up in Boston,MA and lived there until age 19. I graduated high school and moved down to North Carolina to study sound design/ music production. After 3 years of college I moved to Philly to work in the music production industry and build a brand. After dropping that stressful attempt to work in the music industry I opened a private dog walking company. This turned into a 5 year career and grew into something I was not expecting. I soon had to hire a network of help to cover all the demand. Now that I am studying web development I hope to find a way to produce something similar to soundcloud's success as a free platform for producers to share and collaborate. My passion is still music and sound design and I hope to incorporate those ideas into my work.  </p>
